Module **devmenu** makes it possible to use the developer menu.

This menu has two buttons:

- **Constants** - opens / hides a list of some game constants: types of lootboxes, rewards, ribbons and damage. The value of a specific constant (for example, credits) is obtained in the following way: constants.LootboxType.CREDITS
- **Reload Mod** - reloads the mod that calls the menu, when calling a menu of several mods, the "Reload Mod" button will reload the last loaded mod that brings up this menu
